# macOS Setup

## Usage

```sh
bash setup.sh
```

## Additional Stuff

### iTerm2 Setup

> iTerm2 has horrible support for programmatic configuration. Use GUI to configure.

1. Open iTerm2 preference (`âŒ˜` + `,`)

2. In **Profile > General > Working Directory**, choose **Advanced Configuration** and click **Edit**.

3. Choose **Working Directory for New Tabs > Reuse previous...** and **Working Directory for New Split Panes > Reuse previous...**.

4. In **Profile > Colors > Color Presets...**, choose **Snazzy**.

## Notes

- This is very opinionated to my preference. See `config` if you'd like to see what will be installed. `bin` has separate scripts for each installation/configuration.
